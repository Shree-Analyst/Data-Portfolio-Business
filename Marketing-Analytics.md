# Working Title: iFood Data Analyst Business Case (Part 1)
**Background:** iFood is Brazil's leading food ordering & delivery platform, holding over 80% market share as of 2021. As part of their hiring process in 2020 before the pandemic, a business case was sent out to potential candidates. A dataset was made available by a GitHub contributor, presumably a candidate. More information about this business case can be found [here](https://github.com/nailson/ifood-data-business-analyst-test/tree/master). Project walkthrough follows below.

**Alerts:** A more updated version of this case incorporating more advanced analytics may be available. Be sure to click on the most recent version in my portfolio!
